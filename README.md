# Silent Screenshots

A very simple Minecraft mod that removes the "Screenshot taken" chat message.

When taking multiple screenshots in a row, old screenshot messages always appear in the newer screenshots.
This prevents that from happening.

## Installation
This mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.18.
